  <p>
    This website is the first project that I have created for the Summer Immersion Program, and I began the project on June 15, 2020. The website was programmed using Glitch, an IDE. On June 15, the first day, I programmed the main structure of the website using HTML. On June 16, I continued with the HTML and then made the website appealing by using CSS. Further updates are still coming to the site; some things I'd like to include in the future are an image/meme/video gallery and a blog. I'll likely add JavaScript to the site as well in the future.
